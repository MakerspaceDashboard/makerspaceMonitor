## Sariah's idea for an interactive GUI in Python:
    Hi y'all. In my club we have a driver station written in Python that utilizes a library called ImGui. I have seen it be sufficient for my needs then, so if there are no better suited ideas, I've started a mockup of how a display feature could be utilized using this. You will need a few dependencies (which I should hopefully fit in a requirements file) and you should be able to download each one using "pip install " (on Windows) at least for now. In the future we can make that process more streamlined. 
    Once the dependencies are obtained, you can run the display.py file to see an example window that we can expand on as we go about working on this project further!

Stole the demo from this link below:

If anyone else is familar, just hmu in the discord because I have no reasoning on why to use pygame other than that's what I've used before so I am very open to change at this point in time.
